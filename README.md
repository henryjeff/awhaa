# awhaa
Version: 1.1.13

#### Instructions to run:
1. Clone the project
2. Go into the project directory and run ```npm i```
3. Next, build the project with ```npm run build```, and run it with ```npm start```. This will start the server on ```localhost:3000```
4. To access the webapp, go to ```localhost:3000```. Awhaa currently only works when emulated on a phone inside of a browser, so you will have to do that in the browsers web tools to get it working.
5. All done
